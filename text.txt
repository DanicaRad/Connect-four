what HTML would be useful for the game board itself?
    - table for game board

how could you represent a played-piece in the HTML board?
    - colored game piece circles in the table

in the JavaScript, what would be a good structure for the in-memory game board?
    - an array of arrays to represent the html table

what might the flow of the game be?
    - empty html table x rows, y columns
    - empty array of y arrays with x nulls
    - event listener on each colum to add game piece element to html table and update empty array
    - functions to determine where in column and array each piece will go
    - place piece and player represented number in array
    - function to determine when game is won 

Then, write down some functions names/descriptions that would be useful for this game.
    - function to create html table
    - create js empty array
    - event listener for each column to determine which column is being played by which player
    - find place for piece to determine which row is available in selected column
    - function to place piece in html table
    - function to place played piece in array
    - function to determine if there's a win that's run whenever a piece has been placed



QUESTIONS:

- checkForWin function:
    - can/ does this function use y, x variables from handleCardClick()??

    - _win() is checking to make sure four coordinates contained within each of four possible wins are all on game board and belong to same player...
        *** how does it do that using an arraY [y, x] as value instead of single value? 
        
        is it only checking first y, x or each array within winning array to make sure it is on board? 
        ***************

    - see if there are four player pieces in a winning position once piece is placed

    - in _win(): cells.every([y, x]) --> is the array [y, x] treated a single value? not the index? how is an array treated as the value in an .every method?
